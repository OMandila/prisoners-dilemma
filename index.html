                    <p>
                        In this game, you will play against the computer. You and your opponent are prisoners. You are
                        both
                        interrogated separately, in secret, and you cannot communicate with each other. You both have
                        two
                        options:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>"COOPERATE"</strong> with each other (by each remaining silent), or</li>
                        <li><strong>"DEFECT"</strong> from each other (by one betraying the other)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Instructions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Enter the number of tries that you want to play <em>(the more the better, try <strong>369</strong>)</em>.</li>
                        <li>Select the <strong>Start Game</strong> button.</li>
                        <li>Chose the strategy that you want your opponent to use <em>(of course you can't do this in real life, can you?)</em>.</li>
                        <li>Make your choice on the grid, to either COOPERATE or DEFECT.</li>
                        <li>Review the outcome of your choice(s) in the chart and the scoreboard below the grid.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Expected results</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you both cooperate (remain silent), you both get to serve <strong>1 year</strong> in
                            prison.
                        </li>
                        <li>If both of you defect (betray each other), you all get to serve <strong>2 years</strong> in
                            prison.</li>
                        <li>If one defects and the other cooperates, the defector <strong>goes free</strong>, the cooperator gets
                            <strong>3
                                years</strong> in prison.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Extras:</h3>
            <div id="details">
                <p>
                    * In this game, to "cooperate" means to act in a way that is mutually beneficial, or at least not
                    harmful, to other participants in the game.
                    If a player chooses to "cooperate," they are effectively choosing a strategy that, if
                    reciprocated
                    by the other player, leads to a favorable outcome for both.
                </p>
                <p>
                    * To "defect" means to act in one's own self-interest at the expense of others.
                    In the Prisoner's Dilemma, a player who chooses to "defect" is betraying or going against the
                    other
                    player, seeking a better outcome for themselves even if it means a worse outcome for the other
                    player.
